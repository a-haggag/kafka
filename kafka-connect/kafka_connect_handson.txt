## Steps to use Kafka connect
## we will use kafka connect as a sink to 
        1. simple file.
        2. HDFS.
        3. Postgresql database using Avro connect.

# General steps:
    1. download the plugin you want so if you need to use HDFS sink connector go and download it and put it in /confluent/share/java/kafka/ and unzip it.

    2. choose and configure the type of the main connector:
            a. connect-standalone.properties            --- etc/kafka/connect-standalone.properties
            b. connect-distributed.properties           --- etc/kafka/connect-distributed.properties
            c. connect-avro-standalone.properties       --- etc/schema-registry/connector-avro-standalone.properties
            d. connect-avro-distributed.properties      --- etc/schema-registry/connector-avro-distributed.properties

    3. choose and configure the specific connector you want to use:
        you can create any configuration file as you want.
            a. connect-file-sink.properties
            b. connect-hadoop-sink.properties
            c. connect-postgresql-sink.properties

    4. run the command to start the connector using the configurations you made:
        a. bin/connect-standalone etc/kafka/connect-standalone.properties etc/kafka/connect-hadoop-sink.properties
        b. bin/connect-standalone etc/schema-registry/connect-avro-standalone.properties etc/kafka/connect-postgresql-sink.properties

# Notes:
    -- if you are not providing a schema for the producer to the topic which you want to connect to you should change the configurations to:
        in connect-standalone.properties:
            key.converter.schemas.enable=false
            value.converter.schemas.enable=false

    -- for the postgresql connector you have to use avro producer with a schema to provide to the database you want to connect to.
    -- avro producer notes:
        a good repo example that worked for me: https://github.com/skyrocknroll/python-kafka-avro-example
